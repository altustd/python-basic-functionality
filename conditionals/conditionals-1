# conditionals-1.py
# This script demonstrates various types of conditional statements in Python, including if statements, if-else statements, elif statements, nested if statements, ternary operators, logical operators, membership operators, identity operators, short-circuit evaluation, multiple conditions, and conditional expressions.   


# If statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

# If-else statement
y = 3
if y > 5:
    print("y is greater than 5")    
else:    print("y is not greater than 5")

# Elif statement    
z = 7
if z > 10:
    print("z is greater than 10")
elif z > 5:    print("z is greater than 5 but not greater than 10")
else:    print("z is not greater than 5") 
      
# Nested if statement
a = 15
if a > 10:
    if a < 20:
        print("a is between 10 and 20")
    else:
        print("a is greater than or equal to 20")   
else:    print("a is less than or equal to 10") 

# Ternary operator
b = 8
result = "b is even" if b % 2 == 0 else "b is odd"
print(result)

# Logical operators
c = 12
if c > 10 and c < 20:
    print("c is between 10 and 20")
d = 5
if d < 10 or d > 20:
    print("d is either less than 10 or greater than 20")

# Membership operator
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]       
if 3 in my_list:
    print("3 is in the list")       
if 6 not in my_list:
    print("6 is not in the list")   

# Identity operator
e = [1, 2, 3]
f = e
if e is f:
    print("e and f refer to the same object")
g = [1, 2, 3]
if e is not g:
    print("e and g do not refer to the same object")    

# Short-circuit evaluation
h = 0
if h != 0 and 10 / h > 1:
    print("This will not be printed because of short-circuit evaluation")

# Multiple conditions
i = 25
if i < 10:
    print("i is less than 10")
elif i < 20:
    print("i is between 10 and 20")
elif i < 30:
    print("i is between 20 and 30")
else:
    print("i is 30 or greater")

# Conditional expressions
j = 5
k = 10
max_value = j if j > k else k
print("The maximum value is:", max_value)

# Nested conditional expressions
l = 15
m = 20
n = 25
max_value_nested = l if l > m and l > n else (m if m > n else n)
print("The maximum value among l, m, and n is:", max_value_nested)
